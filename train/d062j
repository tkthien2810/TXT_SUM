<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="9" wdcount="34"> Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="10" wdcount="35"> Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home, according to industry spokesmen.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="11" wdcount="26"> The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="12" wdcount="23"> The organization estimated residential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="13" wdcount="40"> Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="14" wdcount="17"> Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="15" wdcount="31"> In addition to home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers compensation.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="16" wdcount="15"> Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more from the quake.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="17" wdcount="17"> But industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="18" wdcount="27"> ``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="19" wdcount="5"> The insurers actually could benefit.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="20" wdcount="51"> Industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States earlier this month.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="21" wdcount="17"> An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term, the analysts said.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="22" wdcount="10"> ``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ...</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="23" wdcount="23"> that this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. in New York.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="24" wdcount="21"> Despite their predictions for the long run, the analysts warned that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="25" wdcount="21"> ``It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,'' said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based Langen McAlenney.</s>

<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="31" wdcount="25"> Roughly two-thirds of all insurance policies written in the United States are sold in California, where many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred..</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="32" wdcount="23"> Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="33" wdcount="26"> Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="34" wdcount="15"> They estimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more, business properties are insured.</s>
<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="35" wdcount="22"> Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California voters last year.</s>

<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="11" wdcount="28"> While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know and when did you know it"?</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="12" wdcount="31"> The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake.</s>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="13" wdcount="9"> He was shocked that such a thing would happen.</s>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="14" wdcount="36"> This has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that California stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration, possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase .</s>
</P>
<P>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="15" wdcount="18"> There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether something might have been done.</s>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="16" wdcount="25"> The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.</s>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="17" wdcount="9"> There has been no widespread outcry against the governor.</s>
<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="18" wdcount="28"> While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds, the governor also sets general state priorities .</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="10" wdcount="21"> In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="11" wdcount="27"> Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="12" wdcount="40"> Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="13" wdcount="25"> So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="14" wdcount="42"> By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="15" wdcount="16"> Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="16" wdcount="35"> On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be "less carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0021" num="17" wdcount="16"> The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="9" wdcount="18"> Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="10" wdcount="32"> Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="11" wdcount="34"> The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="12" wdcount="33"> But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="13" wdcount="8"> Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="14" wdcount="15"> Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="15" wdcount="18"> Most insurers already have mobilized their "catastrophe" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="16" wdcount="31"> Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="17" wdcount="16"> About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="18" wdcount="27"> Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="19" wdcount="24"> Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="20" wdcount="41"> State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="21" wdcount="17"> State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="22" wdcount="26"> Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="23" wdcount="15"> State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="24" wdcount="31"> Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="25" wdcount="26"> The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="26" wdcount="31"> Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="29" wdcount="17"> Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="30" wdcount="34"> Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="31" wdcount="33"> However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="32" wdcount="24"> That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="33" wdcount="16"> Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="34" wdcount="33"> Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="35" wdcount="17"> Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="36" wdcount="20"> For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="37" wdcount="35"> Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="38" wdcount="10"> Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="39" wdcount="38"> "We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="44" wdcount="24"> He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="45" wdcount="19"> British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="46" wdcount="23"> Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="47" wdcount="20"> Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="48" wdcount="29"> The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="49" wdcount="25"> Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="50" wdcount="28"> He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .</s>
