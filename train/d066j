<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="12" wdcount="30"> The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="13" wdcount="49"> Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="14" wdcount="17"> Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="15" wdcount="22"> His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="16" wdcount="23"> Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out''.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="17" wdcount="11"> By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="18" wdcount="28"> Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="19" wdcount="15"> To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is the customer is always right.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="20" wdcount="13"> Rule No.2 says just in case the customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1''.</s>

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="25" wdcount="13"> He preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="26" wdcount="27"> Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="27" wdcount="13"> One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he's amassed.</s>

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="34" wdcount="26"> He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="35" wdcount="24"> After serving three years in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="36" wdcount="25"> The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.</s>

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="44" wdcount="13"> The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, ``We have great people''.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="45" wdcount="9"> The Walton family will always be involved, he adds.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="46" wdcount="14"> Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what we produce today.</s>

<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="18" wdcount="7"> But the 71-year-old businessman declined to comment.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="19" wdcount="25"> ``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,'' Shinkle said.</s>

<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="21" wdcount="12"> It just puts him in a position he doesn't want to be''.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="22" wdcount="9"> But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="23" wdcount="37"> Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="24" wdcount="5"> Walton then changed the subject.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="25" wdcount="14"> Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="26" wdcount="11"> Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people.</s>

<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="29" wdcount="30"> Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago.</s>

<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="19" wdcount="19"> Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="20" wdcount="24"> Typical of the Wal-Mart outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed ``a place to grow and to dream'' in a video on the Walton family.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="21" wdcount="20"> After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben Franklin store in Newport in 1945.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="22" wdcount="11"> He lost the lease on that one, and relocated to Bentonville.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="23" wdcount="6"> That's where the story took off.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="24" wdcount="22"> Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="25" wdcount="37"> Walton ``said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores'' and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="26" wdcount="13"> That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's ``learn as you go'' training program.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="27" wdcount="18"> ``I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing the floor with Sam,'' Bogle said.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="28" wdcount="8"> Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="29" wdcount="33"> In one video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="30" wdcount="9"> The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="31" wdcount="30"> ``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was president of a drugstore chain at the time.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="32" wdcount="36"> And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really didn't see a future in it''.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="33" wdcount="52"> Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right time''.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="34" wdcount="17"> At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed 272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="35" wdcount="20"> Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market .</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="6" wdcount="11"> SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="7" wdcount="33"> The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="8" wdcount="28"> By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="9" wdcount="15"> Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="10" wdcount="16"> The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="11" wdcount="41"> He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted on calling 'associates'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="12" wdcount="21"> He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management buzz-words.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="13" wdcount="26"> Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="14" wdcount="27"> He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for good performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="15" wdcount="28"> Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall Street.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="16" wdcount="29"> Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="17" wdcount="6"> 'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="18" wdcount="24"> Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="19" wdcount="44"> It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business, though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations .</s>

<s docid="FT923-5068" num="28" wdcount="29"> Explaining the annual contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets for carrying bait.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="29" wdcount="8"> Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="30" wdcount="36"> 'So I would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . . put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="31" wdcount="13"> I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="32" wdcount="17"> It drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . '.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="33" wdcount="15"> But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="34" wdcount="31"> Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="35" wdcount="12"> For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="36" wdcount="4"> Occasionally, it just grates.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="37" wdcount="28"> 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="38" wdcount="10"> But it helped me learn a lot about financing things'.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="39" wdcount="9"> Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="40" wdcount="31"> The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written this book'.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="41" wdcount="35"> Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="42" wdcount="14"> But these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="43" wdcount="18"> At the end of the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores .</s>

<s docid="FT944-12170" num="6" wdcount="47"> 'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="7" wdcount="22"> Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="8" wdcount="36"> The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="9" wdcount="35"> His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="10" wdcount="12"> What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="11" wdcount="28"> Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="12" wdcount="38"> At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="13" wdcount="19"> Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="14" wdcount="23"> Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="15" wdcount="9"> Within another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="16" wdcount="18"> Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death, however, published material about the company is curiously scarce.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="17" wdcount="32"> This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="18" wdcount="15"> One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="19" wdcount="7"> Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="20" wdcount="39"> Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="21" wdcount="40"> Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="22" wdcount="7"> Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="23" wdcount="36"> As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="24" wdcount="44"> Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="25" wdcount="15"> This technology helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="26" wdcount="21"> But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="27" wdcount="43"> Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every Friday.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="28" wdcount="25"> They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="29" wdcount="29"> District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="30" wdcount="28"> The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation begin the following week.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="31" wdcount="9"> Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="32" wdcount="40"> One was Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="33" wdcount="14"> Another was Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for gigantist America.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="34" wdcount="26"> Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="35" wdcount="5"> It did, and he did.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="36" wdcount="22"> The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the economies of small US towns was positive or negative.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="37" wdcount="23"> If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="38" wdcount="27"> Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the US.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="39" wdcount="19"> But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in building his own American dream .</s>
